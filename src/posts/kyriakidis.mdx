bio: 
The F.H.L. I. KYRIAKIDIS Marbles & Granites SA has been active since 1991 in the extraction, processing and marketing of marbles and granites.
Our worldwide reputation in the natural rock industry has been gained, mainly through our dominance in the white marble sector. Having in our possession various quarries in Greece from where the white marbles are mined Thassos White, PRINOS, VOLAKAS, BIANCO VENUS, BIANCO M & BIANCO VENATINO, and being the largest distributor of white marbles SIVEC Â®, provides us, together with human our potential and the latest technology equipment, the ability to undertake demanding and large-scale projects worldwide and to complete them successfully!

The F.H.L. KYRIAKIDI consists of various quarries, the main headquarters with the marble processing factory, the dry mortar and adhesives factory MARMODOM, as well as the international transport company AETOS. Having everything within walking distance of Drama, we ensure the smooth flow of work without it being interrupted by external factors. An additional subsidiary of the marble trading group is MARMI BIANCHI, located in Marina di Carrara, Italy.

Few companies around the world have the experience, know-how and ability to undertake major projects and complete them on time with complete success. The F.H.L. K. KYRIAKIDIS has proved many times in the past that it is one of them, having delivered works in white marble of high prestige, either artistically processed, or in special dimensions or tiles. The all-white marble covering the Grand Mosque of Abu Dhabi, the National Parliament and Convention Center in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, and the shrines in Mecca and Medina, Saudi Arabia, can certainly prove it. !
